# Twitter archive data wrangling

This is a data wrangling project. The data used mainly comes from the Twitter archive of the user _dog_rates_. The wrangling step consists of three parts: gathering, assessing and cleaning the data using the _pandas_ library for Python. Data was gathered manually as well as programmatically using the _Requests_ library and the Twitter API. Subsequently, the data was assessed, cleaned and stored in one master DataFrame. In the end the cleaned and stored data was used to produce a short analysis and visualization report.
